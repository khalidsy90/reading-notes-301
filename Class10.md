**What is a ‘call’?**

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

---

**How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**
The number of calls to fib in the stack is the number of times fib needs to be called to evaluate fib(n).

fib(50) will have more than 49 calls to the fib function.

---

**What does LIFO mean?**

LIFO rules (last in, first out). Just like a stack datatype in .NET, Java or any other programming language

---

**Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

The following picture illustrates the overall status of the Call Stack in all steps:

**What causes a Stack Overflow?**

A stack overflow is when you've used up more memory for the stack than your program was supposed to use

---

**What is a ‘refrence error’?**
Undefined variables,
Scope,
Strict Mode,
Redeclarations,

---

**What is a ‘syntax error’?**
Brackets,
Parentheses,
Commas,
Semicolons,
Multi-lingual Syntax Confusion,

---

**What is a ‘range error’?**

A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value.

---

**What is a ‘tyep error’?**
TypeError is thrown when an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function.

---

**What is a breakpoint?**

At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values

---

**What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as ‘bugs’) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects. When various subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one module may cause more bugs to appear in another. Sometimes it takes more time to debug a program than to code it.
