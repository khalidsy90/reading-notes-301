**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database**

conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

---

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

a NoSQL Database built on BASE properties might be suitable

---

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

---

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

First of all, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years.

---

**What does SQL stand for?**

SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems

---

**What is a realational database?**

A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows

---

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.

---

**What is a ‘schema’?**

The term "database schema" can refer to a visual representation of a database, a set of rules that govern a database, or to the entire set of objects belonging to a particular user. Read on to find out more about database schemas and how they are used.

---

**What is a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications. NoSQL databases are widely recognized for their ease of development, functionality, and performance at scale. This page includes resources to help you better understand NoSQL databases and to get started.

---

**Howo does it work?**

NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). ... Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.

---

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents.

---

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why ?**

While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

---

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database ?**‬‏

Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability
