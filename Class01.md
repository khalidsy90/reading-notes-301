**Components** are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

- A component is a modular building block for computer software.
- As per OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification defines
- A component is a modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of interfaces.

- The true meaning of the term component will differ depending on the point of view of the software engineer who uses it. Based on that,

### Three different views of Components

- **Three** important views of what a component is and how it is used as design modeling proceeds.

  1. An Object-Oriented View
     - The object-oriented view focuses on the elaboration of design classes that come from both the problem and infrastructure domain.
  2. Conventional view .
     - a component contains processing
       logic, the internal data structures that are required to implement the processing logic, and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.
  3. A Process-Related View
     - make use of existing software components or design patterns, by choosing components or design patterns from catalog.

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture

1. More Control and Lower Maintenance Costs
2. Faster Development to Save Time and Increase Revenue
3. Take Advantage of Specialized Skills

## Things I want to know more about

1. I want to Know more about the diffrance between state&props
2. I want to Know more about the componenet based on class and component based function
